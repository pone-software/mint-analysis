# mint-analysis
A framework to analysis p-one PMT data.

The MINT analysis package processes data recorded by the Andromeda package (e.g., PMT or acoustic data) and applies advanced analysis routines that lie outside Andromeda’s scope.

For PMT data, two analysis frameworks are planned:
- Pygama – Modern, Python-based, fast-turnaround DSP toolkit for time-series data.
Status: Implemented.
- IceTray – The classical IceCube framework and future default for P-ONE data.
Status: Not yet implemented.

Detailed unboarding instructions can be found [on confluence](https://p-one.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PONE/pages/1797849089/MINT+Analysis+User+Onboarding).
